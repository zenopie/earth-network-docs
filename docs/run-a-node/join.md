# Running an Earth node

Everything you need to sync a node on `earth-1`.

If you can't get a node syncing from this page alone, that's a bug in this page —
please open an issue.

> **Not launched yet.** Two values below are marked `TBD` and will be filled in
> with the launch release: the seed address and the genesis hash. Until then the
> network is a single validator and there is nothing to join.

## 1. Get the binary

Download from the [latest release](https://github.com/zenopie/earth-network-chain/releases/latest):

```bash
VERSION=v0.1.7          # use the launch tag
ARCH=amd64              # or arm64

curl -LO https://github.com/zenopie/earth-network-chain/releases/download/$VERSION/earthd_${VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}.tar.gz
curl -LO https://github.com/zenopie/earth-network-chain/releases/download/$VERSION/checksums.txt

sha256sum -c checksums.txt --ignore-missing     # must say OK
tar xzf earthd_${VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}.tar.gz

sudo install -m755 earthd_${VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}/bin/earthd /usr/local/bin/
sudo install -m644 earthd_${VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}/lib/*     /usr/local/lib/
```

Both lines matter. `earthd` links `libwasmvm` — the CosmWasm engine — as a shared
library, and the two are version-locked: a node must never pair one release's
`earthd` with another release's `libwasmvm`. The tarball ships the matching copy
in `lib/`, along with the C++ runtime the proof verifier needs.

The binary looks for them at `../lib` relative to itself, which is why installing
to `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/lib` works with no `ldconfig` and no
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Keep the pair together if you install somewhere else.

Check it:

```bash
earthd version --long
```

The `version` and `commit` it prints are how you answer "am I running what
everyone else is running" — the only question that matters during an upgrade.

**Building instead of downloading?** You need cgo and the proof verifier:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y clang python3 binutils libc++-dev libc++abi-dev
cd third_party/barretenberg-go && ./scripts/build-wrapper.sh --platform linux_amd64
cd ../.. && make install
```

There is also a container image at `ghcr.io/zenopie/earth-network-chain`, pinned
by digest. See [docker/README.md](https://github.com/zenopie/earth-network-chain/blob/master/docker/README.md).

---

## 2. Initialise

```bash
earthd init "<your-moniker>" --chain-id earth-1
```

---

## 3. Install genesis — and check it

This is the step that decides whether you join `earth-1` or start your own chain
alone. A node whose genesis differs by one byte computes a different app hash and
will never agree with anyone.

```bash
curl -L -o ~/.earth/config/genesis.json \
  https://github.com/zenopie/earth-network-chain/releases/download/$VERSION/genesis.json

sha256sum ~/.earth/config/genesis.json
```

It must print:

```
TBD — published with the launch release
```

If it doesn't, stop. Don't work around it.

```bash
earthd genesis validate-genesis
```

---

## 4. Configure

**Seeds and reachability** — in `~/.earth/config/config.toml`:

```toml
seeds = "TBD@seed.erth.network:26656"
# The address other nodes should dial to reach you. Set it if this node is
# behind NAT, a container, or a cloud provider that maps ports — otherwise
# CometBFT advertises the address it sees on itself, hands that to every peer
# it meets, and nobody can dial you back.
external_address = "your.host.or.ip:26656"
```

Port **26656** has to be reachable from outside for peers to connect to you. A
node can sync without that — it dials out — but it will never be dialled, which
means it contributes nothing to the network's connectivity and cannot serve
state sync to anyone.

Running from the Docker image, these are `SEEDS`, `PERSISTENT_PEERS` and
`EXTERNAL_ADDRESS` environment variables; the entrypoint writes them into
`config.toml` on every start, so a restart is enough to change one.

**Minimum gas price** — in `~/.earth/config/app.toml`. **Required. The node will
not start without it**, and the error doesn't say which file to edit:

```
set min gas price in app.toml or flag or env variable
```

Below this value your node won't relay a transaction. This is a per-node setting,
not a chain rule — there is no fee module, so the network's real floor is whatever
most validators pick:

```toml
minimum-gas-prices = "0.005uerth"
```

**Pruning** — pick by what the node is for, in `app.toml`:

| role | setting |
| --- | --- |
| validator | `pruning = "default"` |
| public RPC | `pruning = "custom"`, `pruning-keep-recent = "362880"`, `pruning-interval = "100"` |
| archive | `pruning = "nothing"` — grows without limit |

**Snapshots** — on by default, and worth leaving on:

```toml
snapshot-interval = 1000      # ~80 minutes at 5s blocks
snapshot-keep-recent = 5
```

This is what lets *other* people state-sync from you. `0` disables it. If
everyone disables it, nobody can join without replaying the whole chain.

If you change `pruning`, check the states a snapshot needs are still kept —
`pruning = "default"` keeps far more than the snapshot interval, so the two do
not collide.

**Don't** enable `enabled-unsafe-cors` on a validator. It lets any website read
your node and broadcast through it. If you're serving a browser app, run a
separate read-only node for that.

---

## 4b. State sync (optional, but much faster)

Instead of replaying every block, fetch state at a recent height from a peer.

**This chain benefits more than most.** Replaying a block re-executes its
transactions, and every passport registration verifies a zero-knowledge proof.
A chain that mostly moves tokens replays quickly; this one re-runs a proof per
registration, so replay cost grows with adoption.

Get a trust height and hash a little behind the tip:

```bash
RPC=https://rpc.erth.network
LATEST=$(curl -s $RPC/block | jq -r .result.block.header.height)
TRUST_HEIGHT=$(( LATEST - 2000 ))
TRUST_HASH=$(curl -s "$RPC/block?height=$TRUST_HEIGHT" | jq -r .result.block_id.hash)
echo "$TRUST_HEIGHT  $TRUST_HASH"
```

Put them in `~/.earth/config/config.toml` under `[statesync]`:

```toml
enable = true
rpc_servers = "https://rpc.erth.network:443,https://rpc.erth.network:443"
trust_height = <TRUST_HEIGHT>
trust_hash = "<TRUST_HASH>"
trust_period = "168h0m0s"
```

`rpc_servers` needs **at least two entries** — the same address twice is
accepted, though two independent ones are better.

Then start with an empty data directory:

```bash
earthd tendermint unsafe-reset-all --home ~/.earth --keep-addr-book
earthd start
```

The log shows `Discovering snapshots`, then `Fetching snapshot chunks`. If it
sits on `Discovering snapshots` with no progress, no peer is offering one —
check `snapshot-interval` is non-zero on the node you are syncing from.

---

## 5. Start

```bash
earthd start
```

Watch it catch up:

```bash
curl -s localhost:26657/status | jq .result.sync_info
```

`catching_up: false` means you're synced.

---

## Hardware

| | validator | public RPC | archive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CPU | 4 cores | 4 cores | 8 cores |
| RAM | 16 GB | 16 GB | 32 GB |
| Disk | 500 GB SSD | 1 TB SSD | 2 TB+ SSD |

SSD, not spinning disk — the node fsyncs every block.

**One thing specific to this chain:** every passport registration verifies a
zero-knowledge proof on-chain, which is CPU-heavy and cannot be skipped. Budget
more CPU than a chain of this size would normally need.

---

## Becoming a validator

Sync first. A node that isn't caught up can't validate.

Write `validator.json`:

```json
{
  "pubkey": PASTE_OUTPUT_OF_show-validator,
  "amount": "1000000uerth",
  "moniker": "<your-moniker>",
  "commission-rate": "0.1",
  "commission-max-rate": "0.2",
  "commission-max-change-rate": "0.01",
  "min-self-delegation": "1"
}
```

`pubkey` is the whole JSON object from `earthd comet show-validator`, pasted in
unquoted — not a string.

```bash
earthd tx staking create-validator validator.json \
  --chain-id earth-1 --from <your-key> --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5
```

**Your consensus key should not live on the node.** Use a remote signer — see
[Protecting the consensus key](./remote-signer.md). It fails closed: with
a signer configured and none answering, your node signs nothing rather than
signing with a key it shouldn't have.

Double-signing gets you slashed and tombstoned permanently. Never run two nodes
with the same consensus key — not during a migration, not for a few seconds.

---

## Upgrades

Upgrades halt the chain at an agreed height. Your node stops on its own and waits.

Use [cosmovisor](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/tooling/cosmovisor) so the
new binary is staged in advance and swaps automatically, instead of you doing it
by hand at whatever hour the height lands.

Each upgrade's release notes give the name, the height, and the binary.

---

## If something goes wrong

**"expected chain id earth-1"** — wrong genesis. Redo step 3.

**Wrong app hash at a height** — your genesis differs from everyone else's, or
you're on the wrong binary. Check both hashes.

**"set min gas price in app.toml"** — the node won't start until
`minimum-gas-prices` is set in `app.toml`. See step 4.

**No peers** — your seeds are wrong, or port 26656 isn't reachable. Peers have to
be able to dial you.

**Stuck at a height with peers connected** — usually an upgrade you haven't
applied. Check the releases page.

**State sync stuck on "Discovering snapshots"** — no peer is offering one. The
node you are syncing from needs a non-zero `snapshot-interval`, and a snapshot
cannot be produced for a height already passed.
