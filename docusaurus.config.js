// another chain's documentation already knows how to move around this one.
//
// Docs-only mode — no blog, no separate landing page. The site *is* the docs, and
// `/` is the introduction.
//
// Served from its own subdomain rather than erth.network/docs. That is the Cosmos
// convention (docs.cosmos.network, docs.osmosis.zone, docs.celestia.org) and it is
// also the only one that deploys without a proxy: GitHub Pages takes a custom
// domain natively, whereas a path would need a rule in front of the app — and the
// app is a single-page router that would otherwise swallow /docs itself.

// GitHub Pages reads to decide the custom domain. Deriving both from one place
// means they cannot disagree, and disagreeing is not subtle: the wrong baseUrl
// 404s every stylesheet and script, leaving a page of unstyled text.
//
// No CNAME  -> project Pages at zenopie.github.io/earth-network-chain/
// CNAME     -> that domain at the root
//
// So publishing to docs.erth.network is one step: create static/CNAME containing
// the domain, once its DNS record resolves. Creating it earlier only breaks the
// github.io URL, because Pages refuses a domain that does not point at it.
